Bluetooth: Peripheral AMOTA
###########################

Overview
********

A sample to demostrate the Ambiq BLE AMOTA service. The Ambiq
OTA APP will discover the AMOTA service after connecting with
the board and the user can load the binary which is for updating
and prestored in the smartphone from the APP home page. The APP
will show progress bar if the OTA has been started successfully.

Requirements
************

* A apollo4p_blue_kxr_evb
* A Android or iOS smartphone installed with Ambiq OTA APP

Building and Running
********************

This application can be built and executed as follows:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/bluetooth/amota
   :board: apollo4p_blue_kxr_evb
